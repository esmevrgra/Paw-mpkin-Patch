🐾 Paw-mpkin Patch: A Feline Fall Frenzy

🎃 Overview
Paw-mpkin Patch is a charming, retro-style endless runner game where you guide an energetic cat through a seasonal pumpkin patch. Your mission? Jump over as many obstacles as possible to achieve the highest score!

Inspired by classic one-touch arcade games, this project is built entirely with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and features my hand drawn pixel art.

🕹️ How to Play
The game mechanics are simple and addictively difficult:

Movement: The cat automatically runs along the bottom of the screen.

Jumping: Press the Spacebar or Tap the Screen to make the cat jump.

Goal: Time your jumps perfectly to clear the oncoming pumpkins and obstacles.

Game Over: The run ends if the cat collides with a pumpkin.

The game uses responsive design and works perfectly on both desktop (Spacebar) and mobile devices (Tap).
